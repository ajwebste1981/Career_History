## Production Philosophy & Methodologies

### Production Quotes to Stand By
* "Hope is not a strategy"
* "Trust but verify"
* "You don't need to have all the answers, just the right questions to ask"
* "Fail often and early"
* "Show me, don't tell me"
* "Don't assume you are on the same page"
* "There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know."

---

* Build relationships with all connected teams (Marketing, Comms, QA)
* Anticipate issues months and years ahead

---

### Leadership & Mentorship Philosophy

**Three Pillars**: Empowered Ownership, Radical Transparency, Continuous Growth

#### Empowered Ownership
* Operate on "Trust but Verify" model
* Give teams autonomy to own their work
* Ensure teams have tools and data for informed decisions
* Ask right questions rather than providing answers
* Build critical thinking skills
* Foster true sense of ownership

* "Weather Map" system provides single, objective source of truth
* Same information enables honest, collaborative problem-solving
* Focus on solutions, not blame

#### Continuous Growth
* Create culture where it's safe to "fail often and early"
* Structured, data-driven post-mortems
* Focus on process, not people
* Compare estimates to actuals
* Analyze what went wrong

### GaaS Development Philosophy (Learnings from "If We Had A Do Over")

#### Strategic Foundation

**Radical Transparency**:
* Mandate open communication about dates, progress, and risks with leadership
* Enable crucial pivots through honest assessment
* Prevent obfuscation that hides opportunities for improvement

**Clear Product Vision**:
* Establish dedicated Product Manager from day one
* Ensure clear, consistent direction
* Prevent scope creep
* Maintain focus on core experience

**Target Audience & Player Focus**:
* Design and release content for all player types (PvP, PvE, crafters)
* Balance content releases regularly
* Listen to market research and segmentation studies
* Don't focus too heavily on one player type

**Talent Density**:
* Build teams through deliberate vetting process
* Actively manage performance to retain top talent
* Avoid forced absorption of collapsed teams without vetting
* Coach, organize, and streamline to build and retain top talent
* Shed bottom talent to prevent bloated, mediocre teams

#### Production & Process

**Long-Term Planning & Release Cadence**:
* Split team: one group works on next release, another on long-term initiatives
* Swap personnel to reduce fatigue
* Develop multiple pieces of content simultaneously (dungeons, raids)
* "Drip release" content over time to ensure steady stream
* Avoid entire team focus on single large initiatives
* Prevent content droughts
* Avoid constant cycle of "finaling" causing burnout

**Proactive, Pod-Based Structure**:
* Organize into cross-discipline "pods" or "strike teams"
* Own features from start to finish
* Long-term ownership fosters innovation
* Improves communication
* Ensures all disciplines understand impacts (QA, UI, etc.)
* Creates true ownership vs. siloed work

**Empowered QA**:
* Integrate QA as core part of development triad (Design, Engineering, QA) from start
* Empower QA to own quality
* Give QA determining voice in release dates
* Include QA in initial estimation phase for new features
* QA must be able to change dates when quality is poor

**Monetization Strategy**:
* Have robust monetization strategy from start
* Create attractive, desirable "fantasy" skins and cosmetics
* Don't be afraid to show skin
* Implement player-friendly systems (points stores for loot boxes)
* Create monetizable mascot
* Don't make monetization an afterthought
* Ensure store content sells at levels needed to sustain project

**Leadership & Ownership**:
* Trust leaders in their roles, or remove them
* Leaders must stay in their lane
* Provide feedback without directing other disciplines
* Prevents removal of accountability
* Prevents key leaders from assuming roles of other disciplines (e.g., QA, Production)

**Co-Dev Management**:
* Use clearer contract language with defined failure criteria for milestones
* AGS must own and develop critical tech internally
* Use co-dev to support features or embed on teams
* Don't use co-dev to independently build core functionality
* Prevents vague milestones that can be abused
* Prevents long-term maintenance risks

**Release Process**:
* Decouple content updates from risky technical changes
* Makes it easier to identify source of new bugs
* Implement capability to hold and deploy fallback build
* Enable rollback if patch is catastrophic

#### Technical Architecture for GaaS

**Build for Live Ops**:
* Architect systems for reality of live service

### 2K Production Playbook (Processes Implemented)

#### Executive Reporting & Risk Mitigation

**"Weather Map" Reporting**:
* High-level, weekly snapshot communicating project health to executives
* Shows: 
  - What has improved
  - Biggest risks and mitigations
  - Data-backed confidence level for hitting key dates
* Became primary tool for leadership communication
* Created transparency and predictability that didn't exist before

**Scenario Planning**:
* For high-stakes decisions (e.g., launch date shift)
* Present leadership with high, medium, and low-risk options
* Each supported by data:
  - Build quality metrics
  - Bug burndowns
  - Historical completion rates
* Facilitates informed decision-making

#### Quality & Predictability Frameworks

**Feature Complete Tracking**:
* Standardized process to track "weather state" (confidence level) of all core features
* Provides clear, data-driven view of what's off track
* Eventually down to one bar tracking:
  - Where we are vs. where we need to be
  - What's left to have full confidence
* Current confidence for core features of game

**Data-Driven Post-Mortems**:
* Implement standardized, feature-level post-mortems
* Compare estimates vs. actuals
* Create culture of accountability and continuous improvement
* Tracking feedback at major milestones (Vertical Slice, Feature Complete)
* Gather feedback from all teams (Marketing, Commercial, Comms)
* Ensure accountability for follow-ups

**Holistic Milestone Calendar**:
* Central calendar providing developers visibility into all moving pieces
* Includes mobile, marketing, and all project components
* Prevents surprises
* Allows developer to track mobile progress from separate teams within org

#### Team & Resource Management

**HC Tracking Document**:
* System for organizing team focus
* Allocates time/hours
* Ensures clear priorities
* Prevents burnout
* Way to organize team on their focus
* Eventually adopted by finance (lost functionality)

**Outsourcing Schedule & Projections**:
* Data-driven schedule for outsourcing
* Estimated completion times based on vendor averages
* 6-month cost projections for better budget management
* Team capacity for 6 months based on expected workload
* Allows for time off during peak moments

#### Developer Relationship & Accountability

**Rebuilding Trust**:
* When taking over rocky relationship, first step: establish transparency
* Give developer visibility into all publishing dependencies and processes
* Open up processes
* Show work has gone in to prove progress/data is real
* Demonstrate through review of risks and mitigations

**Trust but Verify**:
* Build strong relationships
* Use backend access (Jira, Confluence) without micromanaging
* Expert consultations to validate progress
* Ensure data accuracy
* Establish shared RACI for clear accountability
* Show each team what they are accountable for throughout pipeline
* Build a strong relationship with developer (frequent monthly visits)
* Feel confident they can share updates (changes in schedule)
* Important they don't get burned for transparency
* Backend access helpful but daily monitoring impractical and creates distrust
* Open and transparent conversations (e.g., "if we go over budget in 6 months, let's talk now")
* Get ahead of issues and avoid surprises
* (Worst case) Attend/lead sprint reviews, retros, and team planning for shared visibility
* Pull in experts to align on task work with co-developers

---

### Good Scheduling Practices (Repeat Monthly)
* Make sure ALL dependencies for all teams represented
* Show resources working on features (no overlap)
* Scale testing accounted for
* QA test pass timing defined
* Time off stubbed in (vacations, life events)
* Service or engine dependencies accounted for
* Bug fixing time represented
* If things coming in tight, plan for bringing things in
* Can we scope if needed?

---

### How to Tackle Building Good Team Culture
* Everyone has capability to be leader
* Focus on asking questions to help drive them to solutions vs. giving answers
* Satisfaction and room for growth is much greater
* Give people opportunity to own and run smaller projects
* Make them accountable for managing sections of game
* Opportunity for team bonding/development (offsites)
* Retrospectives of monthly sprints (how are we doing? Am I being listened to? Can we course correct?)
* Celebrating all wins (especially following direct criticism that is mitigated)

---

### How to Ensure Internal Teams Keep On Top of Projects and Priorities
* Daily standups for tasks in motion (board of tasks)
* Monthly sprints (what have we done, what's next)
* Retrospective reviews of sprints
* Weekly updates (top risks + mitigations, upcoming milestones, events, project updates)
* Coaching articulation of progress (what do you think is key right now?)

---

### How to Prevent Budgets from Spiraling
* Fail as early as possible
* Test core game pillars first at FPM
* If they fail, team is small so rinse and repeat
* Regular reviews of development progress at key milestones
* Final budgets can't be established before Feature Complete
* Some things can be mitigated at that time for launch
* Have 20% buffer in costs for mitigations
* Plan ahead for worst case scenarios (e.g., pulling in 3rd party developer for finaling)
* Can be removed if game budget is small but prevents asking for more money later
* Transparency and honesty with developer about buffering costs
* Prevent issues further down road

---

### At What Point Do You Know Project Launch Date?
* Typically should know at Feature Complete
* Pipelines in place for each discipline
* Known: how long it takes to create X item
* Path to launch should be clear
* Challenges depending on developer:
  - Ability to prevent scope/creative creep (some better than others)
  - Managing multi-platform development (console vs. PC first) carries considerable risk
  - Managing outsourcing dependencies (tail end determines launch date)
  - Ability to project development path to content complete
* Best case currently: 12-9 months out path to launch solidifies
* Closer to content complete when all content is in game
* Turns to bug fixing
* Based on ability to close X bugs per week vs. QA burndown to submission

---

### How to Push to Bring Predictability with Game Development
* Using historical data collection:
  - Track budget changes between milestones (how frequently did X developer ask for budget increase at Y milestone?)
  - Track date shifts (typically X developer always shifts launch date by a year at Feature Complete)
* Regular review of game pillars being met throughout early pre-pro through Feature Complete
* Asking important questions early:
  - Is there market for this game?
  - Will there still be in future?
* Back up with user data:
  - Marketing insights on game concept
  - Expert evals
  - General user testing

---

### How to Create Alignment Between Publisher and Developer
* Shared understanding of gates/milestone terminology
* What you see as Feature Complete or Alpha they may not align on
* Encourage open and honest communication from developer
* After building good working relationship
* If dates slipping, better to get ahead now than later
* Monthly C-Suite meetings:
  - Project updates
  - Risks + mitigations
  - UT data
  - Budget
* Frequent Production calls to provide publishing insights
* Provide C-Suite expectations (e.g., "doing X will convey progress clearer")
* Daily efforts to prevent surprises
* "What is the developer walking into?"

---

### How to Drive Accountability
* **(Primarily)** Show each team what they are accountable for throughout pipeline
* Both publishing and development side
* Build and discuss RACI to ensure everyone aligned
* Responsible vs. aware
* **(Secondary)** Run shared sheet on weekly basis
* Each accountable party speaks to their part of progress
* 30-1hr standup
* List of game disciplines with connecting sheets
* Should be measurable:
  - Date for reaching next gate (e.g., Feature Complete)
  - Confidence in reaching that date
  - If changed since last check-in

---

### How to Organize Publishing Tasks
* Jira tasks broken into phases of development
* Correctly prioritized (pre-production, production, Feature Complete tasks)
* Subdivided into:
  - Tasks
  - Milestones
  - Events
  - Releases
* Immediate priorities reviewed daily with personal kanban board
* Reviewed monthly in sprint review sessions with product manager (process owner)
* Conduct retrospectives to improve inefficiencies

---

### Benefits/Downsides of Centralizing Services
(Age Ratings, legal review, game capture, outsourcing)

**Benefits**:
* Knowledge carried across multiple titles (not lost when people leave)
* Not owned by one group
* Leaves core team to focus on other production work/higher priority tasks
* Can be outsourced and reduces overall costs

**Downsides**:
* Team in high demand
* When multiple projects shipping simultaneously, could put game date at risk if not scaled up
* Lack of context with title (team knows more about age rating issues vs. centralized team)
* Can lead to mistakes or items coming up late or missed
* Doesn't allow junior folks to learn production role (removes layer of growth)

## Interview Preparation & Strategic Framework

### "Tell Me About Yourself"

**Structured Response**:

"I'm a production leader with over 20 years of experience, specializing in shipping complex AAA titles and building the processes that make studios successful. My career started in QA and moved into production at 2K, where as an Executive Producer, I managed the Borderlands franchise and a portfolio of over 10 titles. That's where I developed my playbook for managing large-scale projects and developer relationships. That playbook includes frameworks I developed for everything from executive 'Weather Map' reporting to data-driven post-mortems, which I used across the Borderlands and Midnight Suns launches.

"Most recently at Amazon, I've focused on driving strategic initiatives. I spearheaded the console launch for New World and created the studio's 'Incubation Teams' program from the ground up, building the business case and operational plan.

"What drives me now is taking those experiences—managing a portfolio at 2K and architecting new processes at Amazon—and applying them at a higher level. I'm looking for a strategic role where I can partner with studios to de-risk projects, elevate quality, and help them succeed on a global scale."

---

### "What Are Your Greatest Strengths?"

**Structured Response**:

"My core strength is my ability to take complete ownership of complex, ambiguous problems and drive them to resolution.

"This is built on two other key strengths. First, I'm a process architect. I don't just solve the immediate fire; I diagnose the root cause and build a durable system to prevent it from happening again. A prime example is when I fixed the broken planning system for the New World console team. They were constantly overscheduled and burning out because planning didn't account for reviews or dependencies. I worked with each discipline to build a new system based on accurate estimates from the ground up, which resolved the pain point and boosted morale. It's the same principle I applied at 2K when creating holistic milestone calendars to align publishing and development teams.

"Second, my colleagues would say I'm a calm and trusted leader. In high-stakes situations like the console launch, I act as a steady communication hub, which builds the trust needed to align multiple teams and stakeholders toward a single goal."

---

### "What Is Your Biggest Weakness or Area for Improvement?"

**Structured Response**:

"An area I've actively worked on is balancing deep, hands-on focus with high-level delegation. During the intense New World console launch, I dedicated myself completely to ensuring its success, which it was. However, in a post-launch retrospective, I received feedback that my outsourced team felt they lacked support during that critical time.

"It was a valuable lesson. I learned that my role as a leader isn't just to solve the biggest problem, but to ensure all my teams are empowered and unblocked. Since then, I've made a conscious effort to delegate more executional work and put better communication structures in place, which allows me to maintain strategic oversight without becoming a bottleneck. It's a key part of my growth moving into a Director role."

**Alternative Response** (ROI & QA Estimates):

"I look to exhaust all options before pursuing a course of action. Sometimes the ROI may not be as high for a project and may warrant cutting losses sooner versus trying to drive a solution. The ROI could be both monetary and personnel (i.e., does it make sense to burn QA's time for something that may not turn a great profit). Knowing when this decision moment needs to happen is a challenge I constantly strive to work on."

---

### "Tell Me About a Major Challenge You Faced and How You Overcame It"

**Publishing Example (2K)**:

"One of the biggest challenges was taking over a developer relationship at 2K that had become strained due to a lack of transparency. There was a deep sense of mistrust between the publishing side and the development studio, which was slowing down progress and hurting morale.

"My first step wasn't to look at schedules or budgets, but to rebuild the relationship. I established a principle of 'Trust but Verify.' I opened up our processes, giving the developer full visibility into publishing dependencies, from marketing beats to localization timelines. In return, I used backend access to Jira and regular check-ins to validate their progress without micromanaging.

"The key was creating a shared RACI and a 'Weather Map' reporting system that we both contributed to. This created a single source of truth and shifted the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative. By focusing on rebuilding trust through transparency first, we were able to get the project back on track and deliver a successful product."

**Development Example (Amazon)**:

"More recently at Amazon, a major challenge was the critical deployment bottleneck we faced during the New World console launch. A slow, bureaucratic submission process was jeopardizing a key demo. I analyzed the workflow, built a data-backed case for my team to have self-submission authority, and negotiated directly with central teams to get it approved. This cut our deployment lag by 50% and was crucial for the demo's success. Both situations required diagnosing a root problem—one of trust, one of process—and driving a specific solution."

---

### "What New Process Have You Added to Your Previous Company That Didn't Exist Previously?"

**Amazon Example**:

"At Amazon, the most significant new process was the 'Incubation Teams' program. The studio had immense talent but no formal, agile way to explore new ideas without committing to a full production. I designed the entire framework from scratch—building the business case, the lean operational process with co-dev support, and the P&L. It created a structured, low-risk path from concept to prototype that the studio is now using to drive innovation."

**2K Example**:

"At 2K, I introduced the 'Weather Map' reporting system. When I took over the portfolio, executive reporting was ad-hoc and inconsistent. I created a standardized, weekly snapshot that communicated project health, risks, and mitigations using a simple, data-backed confidence level. It became the primary tool for communicating with leadership, creating a level of transparency and predictability that didn't exist before."

**Additional Processes at 2K**:
* Feature complete tracking process
* Quality evaluation process
* HC Tracking document (allocation of time/hours)
* Finaling calendar for all publishing tasks
* Outsourcing schedule with data to drive (estimated completion times, costs for 6 month projections, team capacity)

---

### "What Is Your Experience Managing P&L?"

**Structured Response**:

"My experience with P&L has been both direct and strategic. As an Executive Producer at 2K, I was responsible for the strategic financial planning of a 10+ title portfolio. This involved creating and managing product budgets, tracking spend against forecasts, and identifying and mitigating overruns. For example, I developed data-driven outsourcing schedules with six-month cost projections to ensure we stayed within budget.

"More recently at Amazon, I took on direct P&L responsibility when I built the business case for the 'Incubation Teams' program. This required me to create a full P&L from the ground up, forecasting all costs, required resources, and the potential return on investment. I also currently manage the budget for our 2025 content spend, driving the trade-off discussions to keep our work aligned with a $3M target."

**P&L Components**:
* EP/SP Manages budget in three parts:
  - Development & Publishing HC
  - Project externals budget
  - Developer advances
  - Pulling in additional revenue ops (Prod & Biz Dev)

---

### "How Do You Reduce Risk with High-Risk, Early Pre-Production Projects?"

**Structured Response**:

"My philosophy is to 'fail often and early' in a structured way. The best way to de-risk pre-production is to answer the biggest questions with the smallest possible investment.

"The 'Incubation Teams' program I created at Amazon is a perfect example of this in practice. It's a framework built specifically to manage high-risk projects. We establish clear go/no-go gates at each phase—concept, paper prototype, playable prototype. Before any significant code is written, we validate the core loop and market viability. This ensures we're not just building something cool, but something that meets a strategic business goal.

"At a more granular level, I apply principles I learned at 2K and from post-mortems on GaaS projects. This includes establishing a dedicated Product Manager from day one to own the vision and prevent scope creep, and implementing data-driven post-mortems even on small prototypes. By comparing estimates versus actuals, we learn and refine our processes with every cycle, making each subsequent project less risky."

**Additional Risk Reduction Strategies**:
* Ensure clear investment thesis for product and team
* Investment committee evaluates project and ability to find gap in portfolio
* Sustainable forecast and post-launch plan
* Hire great people (proven track record of shipping high quality games)
* Keep teams small and lean in early pre-pro to avoid blowing budgets
* Understand makeup of development team (can they handle outsourcing, co-dev?)
* Find the core fun before coming out of pre-pro

**Quality Evaluation at Milestone Gates**:
* Test early and frequently (cycle prototypes) both small and large scale
* Build and evaluate with KPIs early
* If not met, dates and budget need to change
* Provide buffer for failure (extra month(s) burn to ensure teams dissolved)
* Establish budgets that account for buffer (20%+)
* Ensure commercial viability and place in market (IC team)

---

### "What Makes an Effective Executive Producer?"

**Structured Response**:

"An effective Executive Producer wears three hats. First, they are a **Strategic Partner**. They go beyond just shipping a game; they understand the 'why' behind it. They own the business case, manage the P&L, and ensure the creative vision is aligned with the market opportunity. My work creating the Incubation Program at Amazon is a good example of this—I wasn't just producing, I was building a new business capability for the studio.

"Second, they are a **Process Architect**. They don't just manage schedules; they build the durable, scalable systems that allow teams to succeed. This means creating frameworks for clear communication, like the 'Weather Map' reporting I built at 2K, or fixing broken workflows, like the planning system I overhauled at Amazon.

"Finally, and most importantly, they are a **Relationship Builder**. They build trust with creative teams and stakeholders through calm, transparent leadership. They are the communication hub, especially when things get difficult. My experience rebuilding a strained developer relationship at 2K taught me that trust is the foundation of any successful project. Without it, even the best plans will fail."

**Additional Attributes**:
* Champion for the product (face of game for publisher/developer)
* Anticipation of issues months + years down road (risks and mitigations)
* Alignment between executive staff and developer on progress
* Reducing surprises for executive staff
* Effective management of budget (providing buffer, getting ahead of costs)
* Team coaching (mentoring and leveling up)
* Cycling out poor performers so key performers can shine
* Ask questions to help team members find answers themselves

---

### "How Do You Find Alignment Between Publisher and Developer at Executive Level?"

**Structured Response**:

* Key milestone ERB's reviewing progress, status, and next steps
* Alignment for C-suite on where we are and where going next (monthly)
* High-level weekly/monthly reporting process
* Example: Weather reporting (high-level snapshot of where we've been, where going, what could change confidence)
* Trust but verify with developer
* Show work has gone in to prove progress/data is real
* Through review of risks and mitigations
* Ensure accountability is clear
* With next steps, who is accountable for delivering on progress

## My Point of View: The Future of Game Development & Production

This section articulates my strategic vision for the industry's evolution and how I approach the challenges shaping the future of game development and production.

---

### The Evolution of GaaS: From Content Velocity to Sustainable Production

**The Current Reality**:
The live service model has fundamentally changed game development, but the industry's approach is still maturing. Too many studios equate success with pure content velocity—shipping faster and bigger—without addressing the underlying production infrastructure that makes sustainable, high-quality GaaS possible.

**My Perspective**:
Based on my experience shipping New World and analyzing what works (and what doesn't) through extensive post-mortems, the future of GaaS isn't just about content velocity. **It's about building sustainable, data-informed production pipelines**.

**Key Pillars for Future GaaS Success**:

1. **Architecture for Live Operations from Day One**
   - The technical architecture must prioritize hot-loadable data, flexible event systems, and robust developer/CS tools
   - These aren't "nice to have" features—they're fundamental requirements
   - Without them, even simple balance changes require full patches and downtime, killing your ability to respond to the live meta
   - Example: WoW's success isn't accidental—their designers can deploy content with minimal engineering support, creating a living, breathing world

2. **The Team Must Play the Game**
   - This isn't a luxury; it's a critical quality gate
   - If your development team doesn't want to play your game, you have a fundamental product problem
   - Internal churn is the canary in the coal mine for player churn
   - Mandate long-running playtests (weeks/months) to properly evaluate the end-game experience that defines an MMO

3. **Parallel Development Streams**
   - The biggest mistake I've seen: focusing the entire team on a single large initiative (like a console launch)
   - This guarantees content droughts and team burnout
   - Solution: Split teams so one group works on the next release while another focuses on long-term initiatives
   - Develop multiple pieces of content simultaneously and "drip release" them over time
   - We tested this in New World Season 8—it received overwhelmingly positive player sentiment

4. **Data-Driven, Blameless Culture**
   - Implement standardized post-mortems that compare estimates vs. actuals at the feature level
   - Focus on process, not people
   - Create psychological safety to "fail often and early"
   - Use historical data to drive predictability: track budget changes, date shifts, and completion patterns by team/developer

5. **Empowered Quality Assurance**
   - QA must be a core part of the development triad (Design, Engineering, QA) from the start
   - They need a determining voice in release dates
   - Include them in initial estimation phases for all new features
   - If QA can't change dates when quality is poor, you're setting yourself up for live disasters

**The Bottom Line**:
The studios that will succeed in the next decade of GaaS aren't those with the biggest budgets or the most developers. They're the ones that build intelligent, sustainable production systems and foster a culture where quality and player experience are non-negotiable.

### AI's Role in Production: Augmentation, Not Replacement

**The Current Hype vs. Reality**:
The industry is experiencing an AI gold rush. Some see it as a silver bullet that will replace entire departments. Others dismiss it as overhyped nonsense. Both perspectives miss the point.

**My Perspective**:
AI is the most significant accelerant for production in a decade—but the biggest wins aren't in replacing creatives. **They're in augmenting producers, automating the grunt work, and freeing up leadership to focus on strategic problems.**

**Real-World Evidence**:

I've built practical AI automation tools using Amazon Q CLI that demonstrate this philosophy:

* **98% Time Reduction**: Manual Jira processes that took one hour (importing 20+ issues) now take minutes
* **JIRA Automation**: Converting design docs to structured tickets, generating release notes from Jira data, cross-referencing tickets with Perforce changelists
* **Intelligent Analysis**: Automated build break user analysis, burndown projections, crash analysis with Backtrace integration
* **Documentation Management**: Confluence centralization, runbook gap analysis, technical documentation validation against code

Additionally, my personal project—Webster AI Chef—demonstrates the potential of AI in product development:
* Full-stack AI-powered PWA with Gemini 2.5 Vision for pantry scanning
* Self-learning Firestore database with AI-driven curation loops
* First-to-market integrations (Instacart delivery, AI-generated pixel art)
* 80+ UI components, 3,900+ lines of backend code

**Where AI Excels in Production** (Based on My Implementation):

1. **Pattern Recognition & Automation**
   - Identifying duplicate Jira tickets
   - Flagging stale work items automatically
   - Auditing processes and identifying gaps
   - Cross-referencing data across multiple systems (Jira, Perforce, Jenkins, Confluence)

2. **Data Synthesis & Reporting**
   - Generating executive-ready status reports from raw Jira data
   - Creating player-facing release notes automatically
   - Building burndown projections based on historical velocity
   - Aggregating meeting notes and action items from Zoom transcripts

3. **Workflow Acceleration**
   - Converting high-level documents (GDD, TDD) into actionable task hierarchies
   - Replicating complex Jira structures (MTX pipelines, seasonal content)
   - Stream parity checking between mainline and stabilization branches
   - Automated labeling for copy-up processes

**Where Humans Remain Essential**:

* Strategic decision-making and prioritization
* Relationship building and trust creation (my "Trust but Verify" approach)
* Creative vision and quality judgment
* Navigating ambiguity and organizational politics
* Coaching and mentorship
* Reading the room and adapting communication

**The Future I'm Building Toward**:

The most effective producers of the next decade will be "AI-augmented." They will:
* Use AI to automate reporting, freeing up time for strategic thinking
* Leverage AI for data-driven forecasting, making decisions based on patterns humans can't easily see
* Employ AI for process auditing, ensuring compliance and quality at scale
* Focus their human expertise on what truly matters: people, relationships, and vision

**My Commitment**:
I actively train teams on AI applications. I build tools that reduce manual work. I champion the philosophy that AI is a tool to make great producers exceptional, not a replacement for human judgment and leadership.

### Sustainable Team Culture: Solving the Talent Density Problem

**The Industry's Silent Crisis**:
Game development is burning out its best people. High talent density—the concentration of exceptional performers on a team—is the single biggest predictor of project success. Yet the industry's default practices actively destroy it.

**The Problem**:

Based on my experience at both 2K and Amazon, I've seen teams become bloated and mediocre through:
* **Forced Absorption**: Collapsed teams absorbed without vetting processes
* **Lack of Performance Management**: Inability or unwillingness to cycle out poor performers
* **Hero Culture**: Rewarding individuals who work unsustainable hours instead of building sustainable systems
* **Political Protection**: Keeping underperformers due to relationships rather than merit
* **Burnout Normalization**: Treating constant crunch as a badge of honor rather than a process failure

**My Leadership Philosophy for High Talent Density**:

This isn't theory—it's a practical framework I've used to mentor over 30 producers and leads across 2K and Amazon.

**1. Empowered Ownership ("Trust but Verify")**

* Give teams autonomy to own their work completely
* Ensure they have tools and data for informed decisions
* My role: Ask the right questions to guide them to their own solutions
* This builds critical thinking and true ownership
* People don't burn out when they have control; they burn out when they're powerless

**2. Radical Transparency**

* Be radically transparent about project health, risks, and strategic goals
* The "Weather Map" system provides a single, objective source of truth
* When everyone has the same information, we solve problems collaboratively
* No surprises, no blame games, no hidden agendas
* Trust is the bedrock of high-performing teams

**3. Continuous Growth Through Blameless Post-Mortems**

* Create a culture where it's safe to "fail often and early"
* Structured, data-driven post-mortems that compare estimates vs. actuals
* Focus on process, not people
* Celebrate learning and improvement
* This creates psychological safety—the foundation of innovation

**4. Deliberate Team Building**

* Build teams through vetting processes, not forced absorption
* Actively manage performance: coach up or coach out
* Ensure diversity of thought and skill
* Create clear accountability (shared RACIs)
* Small, high-performing teams beat large, mediocre ones every time

**5. Sustainable Practices, Not Hero Culture**

* Process failures are leadership failures, not opportunities for heroes
* If someone is working weekends regularly, I haven't done my job
* Celebrate process improvements, not unsustainable effort
* Build systems that work when people take vacation
* Model work-life balance from the top

**Real-World Application**:

At Amazon, when I received feedback that my outsourced team felt unsupported during the intense console launch, I didn't dismiss it. I took it seriously:
* Immediately re-engaged with structured communication
* Implemented better delegation and support structures
* Learned that my role isn't just solving the biggest problem—it's ensuring all teams are empowered
* This lesson directly informs how I now structure teams to prevent bottlenecks

**The Measurable Impact**:

Teams I've led and mentored have:
* Higher retention rates for top performers
* Lower burnout and attrition
* More accurate estimates over time (through continuous post-mortem learning)
* Higher team morale scores (anonymous surveys)
* Greater ownership and proactive problem-solving

**The Future of Team Culture**:

The studios that win the war for talent will be those that:
* Actively build and protect high talent density
* Create psychological safety for innovation
* Empower teams with transparency and ownership
* Make sustainable practices the norm, not the exception
* Measure and value team health as rigorously as they measure velocity

This isn't soft skill management—this is strategic competitive advantage.

## The 30-60-90 Day Plan Template

This framework represents my approach to onboarding in any new leadership role. It's designed to deliver measurable value quickly while building the foundation for long-term success.

---

### Philosophy: Listen, Diagnose, Deliver

The first 90 days are critical. Move too fast without context, and you risk implementing solutions for the wrong problems. Move too slow, and you lose credibility. This plan balances learning with action.

**Core Principles**:
* **Assume Nothing**: Every organization has hidden complexity and unwritten rules
* **Build Trust First**: Relationships enable change; directives without trust create resistance
* **Deliver a Quick Win**: Demonstrate value early to build credibility for larger initiatives
* **Use Data**: Opinions are cheap; data-driven insights drive alignment

---

### First 30 Days: Listen & Learn

**Primary Goal**: Absorb all critical information and build key relationships.

**Guiding Question**: "What is the current state, and why?"

#### Week 1: Stakeholder Mapping & Relationship Building

**Internal Stakeholders**:
* 1:1s with all direct reports (understand their goals, pain points, working style)
* Meet with peers across disciplines (Design, Engineering, QA, Marketing, Publishing)
* Introductory meeting with executive leadership (understand their priorities and concerns)

**External Stakeholders** (if applicable):
* Developer partners or studios (establish rapport, understand relationship history)
* First-party contacts (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo)
* Key vendors or co-dev partners

**Output**: Stakeholder map with key relationships, communication preferences, and initial pain points identified

#### Week 2-3: Process & Documentation Deep Dive

**Audit Current State**:
* Review all active project documentation (GDDs, TDDs, schedules, RACIs)
* Analyze current P&Ls and budget tracking processes
* Examine existing frameworks (reporting, milestone gates, planning processes)
* Study historical data (past post-mortems, date shifts, budget overruns)

**Attend & Observe**:
* Shadow all recurring meetings (standups, sprint planning, exec reviews)
* Sit in on developer calls and studio syncs
* Observe existing reporting and communication patterns

**Access & Tools**:
* Gain access to all relevant systems (Jira, Confluence, Perforce, Jenkins, Backtrace)
* Review team capacity, headcount plans, and org charts
* Understand current tool stack and pain points

**Output**: "State of Production" audit document with findings (strengths, gaps, opportunities)

#### Week 4: Synthesis & Hypothesis Formation

**Analyze & Identify Patterns**:
* Common pain points across multiple stakeholders
* Gaps between stated process and actual practice
* Areas where lack of process is causing thrash
* Quick wins vs. long-term structural improvements

**Draft Initial Hypotheses**:
* "The biggest bottleneck appears to be X because Y"
* "Teams are struggling with Z due to lack of A"
* "We have an opportunity to improve B with minimal disruption"

**Output**: Prioritized list of potential improvements with supporting evidence

---

### Days 31-60: Diagnose & Align

**Primary Goal**: Validate hypotheses, align on priorities, and secure buy-in for a first initiative.

**Guiding Question**: "What is the highest-impact improvement I can deliver in the next 30 days?"

#### Week 5-6: Validation & Alignment

**Validate Hypotheses**:
* Present initial findings to direct reports for feedback
* Conduct focused follow-up conversations with key stakeholders
* Review findings with executive leadership
* Ensure diagnosis is accurate and addresses real pain, not symptoms

**Build the Case**:
* Quantify the problem (e.g., "We spend 15 hours/week on manual Jira updates")
* Articulate the opportunity (e.g., "Reducing this by 80% frees up time for strategic work")
* Propose a specific solution with measurable outcomes
* Align on success metrics (e.g., "Time saved," "Improved predictability," "Team morale score")

**Secure Buy-In**:
* Present "State of Production" analysis to leadership
* Propose a specific first initiative for a "quick win"
* Get explicit approval and resources to proceed
* Clarify scope, timeline, and expected outcomes

**Example First Initiative** (based on my real implementations):
* Implement "Weather Map" executive reporting to standardize communication
* Automate release notes generation from Jira to save 10+ hours per release
* Create feature status tracking process to improve visibility
* Establish data-driven post-mortem process for continuous improvement

**Output**: Approved action plan for first initiative with defined success criteria

#### Week 7-8: Build & Prepare

**Design the Solution**:
* Create the new process, template, or framework
* Build any necessary automation or tooling
* Draft documentation and training materials
* Identify pilot team or project for initial rollout

**Prepare for Rollout**:
* Socialize the change with affected teams
* Address concerns and gather feedback
* Refine based on input
* Create a rollout plan with clear milestones

**Output**: Ready-to-deploy solution with documentation and rollout plan

---

### Days 61-90: Execute & Deliver an Early Win

**Primary Goal**: Successfully implement the first initiative and demonstrate measurable value.

**Guiding Question**: "How do we prove this works and set the foundation for future improvements?"

#### Week 9-10: Rollout & Iteration

**Launch the Initiative**:
* Roll out to pilot team or across organization (depending on scope)
* Provide training and support
* Be highly visible and accessible during the transition
* Monitor closely for issues or confusion

**Gather Real-Time Feedback**:
* Check in daily with users in the first week
* Address blockers immediately
* Make rapid adjustments based on feedback
* Communicate changes transparently

**Maintain Momentum**:
* Celebrate early wins publicly
* Share examples of the new process working well
* Reinforce why the change matters

**Output**: Successfully implemented process with active user adoption

#### Week 11-12: Measure, Present, & Plan

**Measure Impact**:
* Collect data on success metrics (time saved, improved quality, team sentiment)
* Compare before/after state quantitatively
* Gather qualitative feedback through surveys or interviews
* Document lessons learned

**Present Results**:
* Create executive summary of the initiative and its impact
* Present to leadership with data on outcomes
* Highlight team contributions and collaboration
* Be transparent about what worked and what didn't

**Plan Next Steps**:
* Propose roadmap for next quarter based on learnings
* Identify next high-impact improvement
* Align on longer-term strategic initiatives
* Establish regular cadence for ongoing improvements

**Output**: Results presentation, lessons learned document, and Q2 roadmap

---

### Day 90 Deliverables: Proof of Value

By the end of the first 90 days, I will have delivered:

1. **Stakeholder Trust**: Built relationships across the organization through listening and collaboration
2. **Data-Driven Diagnosis**: Comprehensive "State of Production" analysis with evidence-based recommendations
3. **Measurable Impact**: At least one implemented process improvement with quantified results
4. **Strategic Roadmap**: Clear plan for the next 6-12 months aligned with business objectives
5. **Team Confidence**: Demonstrated that I understand the context, can execute, and deliver value

---

### Customization for Specific Roles

This template adapts based on the role:

**For a Studio Partnership Role**:
* First 30 days: Focus on developer relationships and understanding studio dynamics
* Days 31-60: Identify gaps in communication or process between publisher and developer
* Days 61-90: Implement shared reporting framework or improved milestone process

**For a Portfolio Management Role**:
* First 30 days: Audit all active projects, P&Ls, and risk profiles
* Days 31-60: Standardize executive reporting across portfolio
* Days 61-90: Implement portfolio-level KPI tracking and risk dashboard

**For an Internal Development Role**:
* First 30 days: Understand team dynamics, current processes, and project health
* Days 31-60: Identify biggest process bottleneck (planning, reporting, or quality)
* Days 61-90: Implement improved process (e.g., accurate estimation framework or Feature Complete tracking)

---

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Builds Credibility Through Listening**: People support what they help create
2. **Demonstrates Strategic Thinking**: Shows I can diagnose root causes, not just symptoms
3. **Delivers Tangible Value Quickly**: Proves I can execute, not just analyze
4. **Sets Foundation for Long-Term Success**: Quick win builds trust for larger initiatives
5. **Data-Driven**: Removes subjectivity and creates shared understanding
6. **Scalable**: First win becomes template for continuous improvement

This isn't a theoretical exercise—it's the exact approach I've used to successfully onboard at Amazon Games and in new roles at 2K, consistently delivering measurable improvements within the first quarter.

## Closing Process (Console/Platform Submissions)

### Bug Projection & Planning
* Establish QA bug projection 10-12 months from release
* QA provides projection for total active bugs for Seasons 4-6
* Provide burn rate to get to submission
* Set target bug number by date (Major & Minor)
* Release management & Production drives messaging and plan
* Focus on bugs, not tasks per team
* Use historical data to drive projections
* Look at scope of features releasing
* Look at backlog per team
* Console team provides hard date for what needs to be hit
* Expectation: bug burndown provided per team for needed fix rate

### Branch Plan & Process
* Central triage plan
* Run book (ready for beta testing, starting with PC runbook)
* Buffer time in schedule for build failures and build creation

### Main Submission Process

**Central Triage Team** (8 weeks prior to submission - < 200 MF's):
* Teams continue daily triage with escalation point
* Individual team determines what to escalate
* If XR/TRC bug, updated with details
* Component field tracking
* Create Jira structure board to pull all (resolved, active)
* Central team utilizes everyday
* Prod, SDM, PO, QA evaluate:
  - Must fixes for submission (XR's, TRC's, critical path blockers, crashes, performance)
  - Bugs that need to move to patch folder (Majors and minors)

**ML Copy Up "Branched"** (5 weeks prior to submission - < 80 MF's):
* 5 weeks from submission looking at just must fix bugs
* Prod, SDM, PO, QA evaluate same criteria as central triage
* This team prioritizes what bugs need fixing for each discipline
* Pull in copy up closer to stab > cert

**Stab to Cert "Submission Blockers Only"** (3 weeks prior - 0-10 MF's):
* Central triage approved changes
* Shelved changes for patch

**Final Submission Build Review** (1 week from submission)

### Rapid Patch Submission Process
* Identifying patch fixes based on community feedback
* ML Copy Up "Branched" (5 days prior to submission)
* RM reviews issues in patch folder to move to Stab
* Stab to Cert "Submission Blockers Only" (2 days)
* QA verifies all issues in Stab
* Final submission build review (1 day)

## Co-Developer Milestone Feedback Process

### Feedback Goals
* Re-enforce accountability with co-developer on owning work end to end
* Align co-developer and AGS team on what's been agreed upon
* Provide consistent process across all co-developer interactions
* Clear expectations for when feedback will be received
* Create paper trail of prior, current, and future feedback & commitments
* Prevent disputes
* Serve both AGS and co-developer on what's been agreed at all stages
* Force conversation early if milestone delivery not met
* Help course correct

### Milestone Feedback Loop
* Producer, PO & SDM (triad) review milestone within 5 days
* Highlight early (within day of delivery) any missing material/work
* Ensure alignment week before delivery on what's being provided
* Producer accountable for following up, collecting, prioritizing feedback
* Prior to sending, Producer, PO, SDM agree on requirements if issues need resolution
* Create paper trail tracking agreed action items for subsequent milestones
* No ambiguity on what's been discussed and aligned for upcoming deliveries

### Types of Milestone Feedback

**P0 - Required feedback preventing milestone approval**:
* Clear cure conditions provided
* Example: "For Milestone X to be paid, X needs to be provided by X Date"
* Typically due to deliverables not provided or frequent under-delivery

**P1 - Required feedback for next milestone**:
* Clear expectations: resolution required by next milestone
* Does not prevent current milestone payment

**P2 - Non-required feedback**:
* Issues noted during review
* Do not require resolution by next milestone
* Strongly encouraged to review
* Can be escalated later if no feedback provided

### Responding to Milestone Feedback
* Co-developer reviews feedback within 10 working days
* Supply responses for any required issues flagged
* Provide specific date or milestone for resolution
* May not be tied to milestone (e.g., updated deliverables or documentation by given date)
* Expectation: next milestone includes responses and (if required) updated deliverables
* Creates paper trail tracking progress through each milestone
* Ensures alignment between teams on what's provided and what will be provided

## Inception Projects Experience

### Premium vs. F2P Considerations
* Need strong business strategy for F2P with inception opportunities
* Could lead to killing projects sooner
* Due to inability for capitalizing costs at tech feasibility stage

### Project Examples & Challenges

**Project Dagger**:
* Stages managed: Inception / Prototype / First Playable / Vertical Slice
* Challenges:
  - Finding its place in 2K portfolio ("we don't have this type of experience")
  - Challenge viewing it against successful title like Monster Hunter
  - Demonstrating pillars early:
    - Developer focused on holistic flow (home base, purchase mechanisms, mission flow, faction siding)
    - Didn't focus on making M2M combat "fun"
  - Keeping team lean and small (was expensive):
    - Team burn and outsourcing reached high level prior to Vertical Slice (200+ team)
    - Put project at risk
  - Resolving issues through milestone feedback:
    - Feedback given to tackle core experience before demonstrating holistic value
    - Before justifying $60 price point
    - Mixed message created
  - Building MS schedule that worked for the game
  - Getting testing involved early (developer reluctant to have early user testing)
  - Making the investment make sense

**Project Inferno**:
* Stages: Inception / First playable
* Challenges:
  - Brought in with pedigree of prior developer (Art and Design)
  - Focused on systems, not gun play
  - Unclear M2M experience
  - On paper sounded exciting but didn't pan out in-game

## GaaS Games: What Works and What Doesn't

### Not Working

**Development Afterthought**:
* No dedicated teams working in parallel
* Content not ready 30 days after launch
* DAU and CCU drops
* No player base when content released 60+ days later

**Misaligned Post-Launch Content**:
* Introducing new types not inline with player expectations
* Not improving/expanding on post-launch features present in base game
* Not feeding into existing systems

**No Post-Launch Live Systems**:
* No ability to manage micro patches
* No news feeds
* No dynamic ways of delivering updates/news to players
* Game doesn't feel fresh/up to date

**Store in Single Player**:
* Introducing store into single player experience is always high risk

### Working

**Parallel Development**:
* External team working with developer on base game
* Continue creative vision for post-launch content
* Content ready 30 days after launch

**Planned Content Mix**:
* Providing paid content every 30 days
* In between: providing live events for free
* Players can interact with free events

**Micro Patches**:
* Don't need 1st party review
* Can be delivered directly to player quickly
* Especially important for game breaking bugs

**Store Enhancement**:
* Store supports player experience (enhances it)
* Without interfering with growth through gameplay

## Assigning Work (Long Term Planning)

### LTP Process
* Feature alignment meeting - high level overview of season content
* Vision phase to keep Scope Small
* GDD + TDD phase
* Estimation phase
* Schedule phases with alignment around dependencies

### Task Management
* Epics created
* Link tasks to Epics (evaluating burndown)
* Schedule includes: PTO, bug fixing, scale testing, etc.

---

## Bug Fixing Incentive Programs

* **Bug nights**: Chime room setup, Uber Eats vouchers/expense dinner, "DING" in chat when bug fixed, jokes
* **Morning bug updates**: Every morning, send out how many bugs each person fixed that day and their totals (no one wants 0 next to their name)
* **No meeting days**: Defined day so people can stay 100% focused on bugs

## Building a Road Map

Key questions to shape roadmap and priorities:

1. Get majority (if not whole game) defined (genre, look/feel, story) - need Game Design Document
2. Do you have a team? What are roles and responsibilities?
3. Is there a budget? Affects game scope greatly
4. Define cycle of delivery (sprints) - every week or 2 weeks have something tangible to try
5. Doing this part time or fulltime? Affects scope and delivery time
6. Do you have marketing plan? Tons of tasks there
7. Break every feature into smaller pieces and create tickets (e.g., Trello)
8. Start tackling them

**Remember**: This is marathon, not 100 meter dash. Consistently delivering/finishing tasks is key to finishing on time.

## Best Advice for New Producers

* **Listen then talk** (peers, managers, external teams)
* Understand how something works before wading in
* Talkers present their own views before understanding others
* **Build relationships** with all teams (Marketing, Comms, QA)
* Critical to understanding what these teams do
* Allows you to:
  1. Empathize at critical moments (empathy carries weight)
  2. Support requests - they'll be more inclined to help in collaborative challenges
* **Be brief in communication**
* To the point: risks, mitigations, next steps
* Think: what does the person need to hear from you?
* **360 feedback for coaching**
* Gather feedback from managers and peers
* Present it back with your understanding
* Suggestions for improvement based on data collected
* **Keep all parties aligned**
* Your role (while not tackling tasks) is to keep everyone aligned on project progress
* Any time no longer on track, communicate via email, Slack, meetings, etc.

## Why Did You Leave 2K?

* Have been at 2K for 14+ years (18 inc. T2) and shipped numerous titles (BL3, Wonderlands, Tales 2, and MMS)
* Looking to branch out, gain new skills and learn new ways of working to grow personally
* Built strong team of Senior Producers to help manage/transition projects

## Team Size Management Experience

**16 Production Staff** (2K):
* Project Managers, Senior Producers, Producers, Associate Producers
* Running daily standups, sprints, weekly retros
* Via Jira and Confluence
* Tracked risks and mitigations
* Supported Firaxis with team standups (indirectly much larger)

**10 Cross-Functional** (Outsourcing + Console):
* 8 artists in outsourcing
* 2 on console
* Standups, triage, capacity planning, sprint planning
* LTP for both

**15 Cross-Functional** (Amazon - Current):
* Release Management personnel
* Live Ops producers
* Driving project success and career growth

**250+ Team** (Amazon - Overall):
* Current overall team size for New World

## Additional Production Experience Details

### People Management Challenges

**Under Performer for Role**:
* Plan for improvements (verbal, emails, fully documented):
  - Prioritizing reports
  - Prioritizing tasks
  - Focus at start of meetings

**Over Performing but Not in Basics** (verbal, email/slack, documented):
* Focused on basics:
  - Calendar process
  - Daily checklist
  - Email of what being done that day
* Taking on too much
* Improving communication
* Avoiding burnout

**Team Development**:
* Enneagram test with team (seeing best ways to work together)
* Training on how to use JIRA effectively (Tasks with dates & trackable outcomes, Events, Milestones)
